<h2> Exotic Dance Moves</h2>
<p> Yes. you are right on the part of the post doctarate work. I <i>did</i> study exotic tribal dances. To answer your questions my favourite dances are as follows, with definations:</p>

<p>Polynesian chicken dance</p>
<blockquote>A little know but <i>very</i> influencial dances dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around in a circle, like chicken, to encourage their livestock to  be "fruitful"</blockquote>
<p>Iceland brownian buffet</p>
<blockquote>Before the iceland develope the fire as mean of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which involve hudduling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffeling their boddies. One of my student says that he thought this dance inspired modern style dance such as twerking</blockquote>
<p>Arctic robot dance</p>
<blockquote>As an interesting example of historic misinformation engllish explorer in the 1960s believed to have discovered a new dance style characterise by"Robotic" stiled movement, being practiced by inhabitant of northern alaska and canada.</blockquote>
